# soSFS
A highly optimized SFS representation for demographic inference.

soSFS is the "singletons-only site frequency spectrum". It's a performance enhancement that entirely relies on information from depleted or inflated # of singletons under different demographic histories, allowing you to throw out information from all the other bins. Reduces file size AND increases simulation efficiency!

This could also technically be called SoFA (Singletons-only Frequency of Alleles), which is also satisfying, but I prefer soSFS. 

Marcelo's suggestions: 
* gimeless - genealogical information mutilation expected leveraging site spectrum
* Gimelesss - Genealogical informative mutation effectively leveraged with Singleton-only site spectrum
